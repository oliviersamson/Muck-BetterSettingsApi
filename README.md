# BetterSettingsApi

This is a mod of Terrain's [SettingsApi](https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/Terrain/SettingsApi/ "Thunderstore") mod. 

The main goal here was to get compatibility with mods that make use of the original settings pages (like flarfo's [SaveUtility](https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/flarfo/SaveUtility/ "Thunderstore")).

I also cleared up some annoyances like the extremely slow scroll speed and the pages' elasticity when trying to scroll or drag something.

With this mod, things should feel and look mostly like the original game!
